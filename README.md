# Traveller's App
A project for FMI's OOP course

## Idea
Traveller's App is a simple CLI-based application for storing entries of visits to different destinations around the world.

Upon launch, the only available functionality is to register a user or to log in.

Once logged in, we can view added destinations and their ratings, add destinations ourselves, add trips to any of those destinations, add friends and see if any of them have visited the same destinations as us and more.

## Running the application
The application is most-easily run on Linux. All we have to do is execute `build/travellers_app` from the main project directory and the program will launch.

## Doxygen
Doxygen-generated documentation is part of the project. It can be accessed via `html/index/html` for the html version.
