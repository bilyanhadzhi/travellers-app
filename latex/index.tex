Traveller\textquotesingle{}s App is a simple C\+L\+I-\/based application for storing entries of visits to different destinations around the world.

Upon launch, the only available functionality is to register a user or to log in.

Once logged in, we can view added destinations and their ratings, add destinations ourselves, add trips to any of those destinations, add friends and see if any of them have visited the same destinations as us and more.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Running the application}\label{index_autotoc_md2}
The application is most-\/easily run on Linux. All you have to do is execute {\ttfamily build/travellers\+\_\+app} from the main project directory and the program will launch.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Doxygen}\label{index_autotoc_md3}
